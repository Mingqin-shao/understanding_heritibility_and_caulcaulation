Current Courses
Anth 4234: Genes, Health, and Human History
This course uses human genes to study health and history. Through genetic data, we will see how human populations have grown, moved, and mixed. We will also see how humans have adapted to a changing environment, with results that are sometimes beneficial and sometimes unfortunate. The first part of the course provides background on evolution, the second uses genes to study history, and the last deals with adaptive and maladaptive consequences of evolution.
Anth5221/Biol5221: Human Evolutionary Genetics
An introduction to the theory and data of evolutionary genetics. It is about how populations respond to evolution, and also about how evolutionary history can be reconstructed from our genes.
Anth 5485: Graphical Data Analysis
Students will learn graphical methods of data analysis and then use these in projects involving real data. All projects will involve the R statistical package.
Anth 6200: ProSeminar II: History of Biological Anthropology
Honor 2500: The Evidence for Evolution
Both sides of the argument about evolution, in historical perspective.
Old Courses
Anth 1050: Evolution of Human Nature
Our brains, like the rest of our bodies, were shaped by natural selection. But how much does this matter? Many social scientists would argue that it matters very little, since human behavior is transmitted culturally rather than genetically. This course will entertain a different hypothesis. It will seek to explain human nature---our desires and preferences, our virtues and faults, our similarities and differences---using the theory of evolution. Students are encouraged to be skeptical. After all, rational skepticism is the business of science.
Anth 636: Preparing Grant Proposals
Anth5471/Biol5471: Quantitative Models in Evolutionary Ecology (formerly Fundamental Methods of Evolutionary Ecology)
An introduction to the method and theory of evolutionary ecology for undergraduate students and beginning grads. The course will make extensive use of Maple, a computer program that simplifies equations, solves them, and plots the results.
Biol 5410: Molecular Evolution
How biologists go about making sense of genetic differences between species. Team-taught with Jon Seger (Dept of Biology) and Glenn Herrick (Dept of Biochemistry).
